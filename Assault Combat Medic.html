	<p class="R2"> Combat Medics, frowned upend until your killstreak is bigger than theirs. </p>
	<p class="B1"> The Blutsauger is a simple Syringe Gun, swapping out your RPS for rewards for being a well Combat Medic. </p>
	<p class="R2"> Just in case of turning the corner into a very angry Heavy, you can pop a Vaccinator Uber, assuming you healed someone just a little.</p>
	<p class="B1"> Now if your low and you need HP now, jet pull out the Amputator! It increases you RPS by 3, allowing your medic to get a taste of his own medic powers.</p>
